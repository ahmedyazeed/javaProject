Collections Framework:
     Framework is a set of rules and boundaries in which you work;
     It's a collection of classes and interfaces which helps us build
     dynamic programs which are capable of handling large amounts of data.
Why we should learn about Collections?
     Arrays are not good and we need something that is dynamic and more flexible;
     E.g:
     1) Arrays are fixed in size;
     2) No ready made methods, we have to create out own;

ArrayList:
     Better version of Arrays. It's also index based , it's dynamic, we don't
     need to provide thee size before hand and it contains a lot of methods to
     manipulate the data inside it.
Syntax:
     For Arrays we used this:
          DataType nameForArray=new DataType[size];
          String[]arr=new String[5]

     For ArrayList:
          ArrayList<DataType> name foe ArrayList=new ArrayList<>();
          ArrayList<String>arrList=new ArrayList<>();

Methods from ArrayList:
     Size()=> num of elements
     add(element)=>adds new elements to the arraylist
     get(index)=> returns the element on specified index
     remove(index)=>removes the element on the specified index
     remove(element)=>removes the element from the arraylist
     indexOf(element)=>returns the index of passed element
     contains(element)=>returns true if element is present otherwise false
